Description: Main functionality is to provide the algorithmic
    complexity for short strings, an approximation of the Kolmogorov
    Complexity of a short string using the coding theorem method (see
    ?acss). The database containing the complexity is provided in the
    data only package acss.data, this package provides functions
    accessing the data such as prob_random returning the posterior
    probability that a given string was produced by a random process.
    In addition, two traditional (but problematic) measures of
    complexity are also provided: entropy and change complexity.
